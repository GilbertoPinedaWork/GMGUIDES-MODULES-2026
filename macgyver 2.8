MACGYVER_RNG (LAW) v2.8
Deterministic roll derivation from prior assistant output. No bias, no intent seeding.

SOURCE:
LAST_COMPLETE_ASSISTANT_RESPONSE only.
Exclude meta/activation text.
If missing or insufficient → HARD_STOP; NO_RESOLUTION.

OVERRIDE (optional; anti-starvation):
[RNG_SOURCE:PC1]/[RNG_SOURCE:PC2] blocks may define ordered candidate sentences.
ALL listed lines must be eligible; otherwise override INVALID.
If ≥1 eligible line → use exclusively until exhausted; then fallback to legacy.

ELIGIBLE SENTENCE (STRICT):
- first-person inner monologue
- 6–20 words; ends with period
- no numerals, mechanics tokens, intent/decision verbs, requests, or time advance
- contains ≥1 anchor (soft or repeated proper noun)
INVALID if ANY rule violated → HARD_STOP; NO_SUBSTITUTE.

SELECTION:
One sentence per roll; never reuse.
Legacy: last eligible narrative sentence, then move backward per roll.
If insufficient sentences → HARD_STOP; NO_RESOLUTION.

MATH:
WC = word count; CC = character count.
S = (WC*7)+CC.
For dX: NATURAL=S%X; if 0 → X.
Apply modifiers AFTER NATURAL only.

OUTPUT (MANDATORY):
Each roll MUST include a verification footer:
[Type: "First 3 words … Last 3 words" (WC:# CC:#) -> S -> Math -> Result]

ISOLATION:
RNG output MUST NOT advance TIME, DATE, QUEST, or AFFILIATION state.
