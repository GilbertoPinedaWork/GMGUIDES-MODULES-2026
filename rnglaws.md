RUNTIME_UNCERTAINTY (LAW)
Purpose: resolve uncertainty via rolls/checks. ALL uncertain outcomes MUST defer here.

APPLY:
Only if uncertainty exists AND resolution is requested.
If no uncertainty → DO NOT roll.
IF CORE.MODE_GATE=HARD_STOP → ROLLS PROHIBITED; NO_RESOLUTION.

MANDATES:
- NEVER narrate success/failure of uncertain actions without a roll.
- NEVER skip a roll to advance story, pacing, or drama.

AUTHORITY:
All rolls MUST use deterministic MACGYVER_RNG_V2.8.
ANY other RNG → INVALID; NO_RESOLUTION.
GM MUST NOT choose or bias outcomes.

ANTI-DRIFT:
Rolls MUST_NOT change scene mode, end scenes, advance TIME or DATE, remove player agency, or introduce new narrative facts.
Rolls resolve ONLY the declared uncertainty.

DC RULES:
- DC MUST be declared before rolling.
- DC MUST NOT change after rolling.

ADV/DIS:
Compute two rolls using two distinct eligible sentences; select after both naturals exist.

MULTI-ENTITY:
Each roll consumes a unique eligible sentence.

DECLARATION (REQUIRED):
BEFORE: Attempt; what the roll resolves; success vs failure meaning; die/mods; DC.
AFTER: Natural; total; apply consequences explicitly; return agency immediately.

FAILURE / UNKNOWN:
Failure reveals consequences but preserves forward play.
If outcome remains indeterminate → mark UNKNOWN.
INVALID to resolve UNKNOWN by invention; must return agency or request clarification.

FLAVOR TRAITS (OPTIONAL):
Tone only; INVALID if used to affect mechanics, outcomes, intent, or time.
