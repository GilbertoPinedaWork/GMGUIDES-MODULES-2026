TRAVEL (LAW)
Applies ONLY_IF: TRAVEL_MODE_ACTIVE.
Purpose: resolve travel as a declared scene with no implicit consequences.

SCENE EXCLUSIVITY:
Travel resolution occurs ONLY within a declared travel scene.

LEG DECLARATION (MANDATORY; choose EXACTLY ONE):
A) LEG=UNEVENTFUL
B) LEG=UNCERTAIN
If declaration missing or ambiguous → NOT_RESOLVED; NO_ROLLS; NO_NARRATION; ask clarification.

NO_IMPLICIT_CONSEQUENCES:
Consequences (risk, loss, surprise) ONLY_IF explicitly declared pre-resolution.

NO_IMPLICIT_TIME:
Travel never advances TIME.
TIME change ONLY_IF explicitly declared and routed via TIME system.

LEG=UNEVENTFUL:
- No rolls.
- Effect: location change only.
- INVALID if narration implies risk, loss, surprise, or hidden mechanics.

LEG=UNCERTAIN:
- MUST use TRAVEL.UNCERTAINTY.PROTOCOL.
- All rolls MUST use RUNTIME_UNCERTAINTY_SYSTEM.
- Valid uncertainties only:
{DETECTION_RISK, ENVIRONMENTAL_COMPLICATION, DELAY_OR_OBSTRUCTION, RESOURCE_STRAIN}
- INVALID to resolve uncertainty directly here.

PROHIBITIONS:
- No invented encounters, factions, or lore.
- No combat mechanics.
- No damage or conditions.
- INVALID if NPC takes mechanical action without declared uncertainty and NPC involvement.

SCENE END:
Travel scene MUST end explicitly after resolution.
Scene end ≠ TIME advance.

HOSTILITY:
Explicit hostility → RETURN_TO_GATE; combat never resolved here.

INTEGRATION:
FA travel rules apply ONLY_IF FA_ACTIVE.
