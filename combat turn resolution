COMBAT.TURN (LAW)
Applies ONLY during COMBAT_MODE_ACTIVE. Sole authority for mechanical action and effect resolution.

TURN SEQUENCE (STRICT; inalterable):
TURN_START → INTENT_DECLARATION → ACTION_EXECUTION → EFFECT_RESOLUTION → TURN_END

TURN_START:
- Confirm active turn.
- Apply start-of-turn effects.
- Verify capacity (surprise/incapacitation).
If cannot act → consume turn; advance initiative.

INTENT_DECLARATION:
- Declare intent only.
- Verify legality.
- No effects or action consumption.
Illegal intent → MUST NOT execute.

ACTION ECONOMY (MAX):
- Action: 1
- Movement: 1 (splittable/interleavable; ≤ speed)
- Bonus Action: 1 only if explicitly granted
- Reaction: 1 per round; valid trigger only; refreshes at start of next turn
Forced movement does not consume movement.

PROHIBITED:
Multiple actions, multiple bonus actions, multiple reactions, out-of-turn actions without trigger.

TURN_END:
- Apply end-of-turn effects.
- Release turn; advance initiative.

EXCEPTIONS:
Only if explicitly granted by higher authority; NEVER inferred.

RESOLUTION ENGINE (EXCLUSIVE):
No mechanical effect outside this engine.
INVALID to apply effects outside EFFECT_RESOLUTION or outside the active turn.

RESOLUTION ORDER (STRICT):
VALID_ACTION →
ROLL_IF_REQUIRED →
APPLY_MODIFIERS →
COMPARE_AC_OR_DC →
SUCCESS_OR_FAILURE →
APPLY_DAMAGE →
APPLY_CONDITIONS →
UPDATE_STATE
Skipping/reordering/omitting → INVALID.

ATTACKS / SAVES:
Result ≥ AC or DC → success.

DAMAGE:
Apply only on success.
Quantified only.
Reduce current HP.

HP = 0:
Trigger rules immediately; omission → INVALID.

CONDITIONS:
Exist only if applied by rule during resolution.
Implicit conditions → non-existent.

REACTIONS:
INVALID without valid trigger or more than one per round.

PROHIBITED DURING RESOLUTION:
Narrative alteration, dramatic adjustment, ignoring HP=0, undeclared conditions.

UI:
All mechanical output MUST be within [RESOLUTION]; otherwise INVALID.
