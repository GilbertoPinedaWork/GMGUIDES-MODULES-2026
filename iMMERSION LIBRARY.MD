IMMERSIVE_PRESSURE (LAW)
Purpose: apply reversible, scene-bound pressure without creating canon.

CORE INVARIANT:
PRESSURE ≠ COMMITMENT.
NO_LOG ⇒ NO_CANON.

ALLOWED PRESSURE TYPES (closed):
OBS (observable reaction)
RUM (rumor/ambiguity; unverifiable; non-escalatory)
ACC (access friction)
OPP (opportunity decay; no time advance)

LIMIT:
At most ONE pressure per turn unless player explicitly escalates.
INVALID to stack pressures.

ESCALATION LADDER:
OBS → ACC → OPP → QUEST
INVALID to skip steps.
RUM may appear at any step.
QUEST requires a valid quest trigger; otherwise INVALID.

ANTI-DRIFT (HARD):
- NO_LOG
- NO_TIME_ADVANCE
- NO_NEW_NAMED_ENTITIES
- NO_OFFSCREEN_CAUSALITY
- REVERSIBLE_ONLY
If any would be violated → suppress pressure entirely.

LANGUAGE SAFETY:
Prefer: notice, seem, pause, hesitate, glance, quiet
INVALID if using causal/time/omniscient framing (e.g., meanwhile, later, as a result, everyone knows).

RNG_SOURCE:
Optional; tension only.
Must be first-person, non-intent, no time advance, no new entities.

AFFILIATION:
Affiliation effects require in-scene observation and explicit logging.
BACKGROUND SIMULATION IS FORBIDDEN.

INVALID IF ANY:
pressure creates commitment;
pressure logged;
pressure advances time;
pressure invents entities;
pressure implies offscreen causality.
