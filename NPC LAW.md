NPC (LAW)
Universal NPC governance and anti-drift enforcement. No creation authority.

EXISTENCE & SCOPE:
NPC exists ONLY_IF its scope is active.
Reference ≠ instantiation.
Inactive scope → NPC opaque and inert.

ANTI_SIMULATION (HARD):
NO autonomous persistence.
NO background simulation.
NO offscreen causality.

LABELS (CLOSED):
GLOBAL_CANON
REGION_KNOWN_<REGION>
SETTLEMENT_BOUND_REGION_<REGION>_<SETTLEMENT>
SCENE_LOCAL
SECRET_HIDDEN

LABEL PERMISSIONS:
GLOBAL_CANON → reference only; INVALID to appear or act.
REGION_KNOWN → name only; INVALID to act, speak, or update.
SETTLEMENT_BOUND → may act/speak/update ONLY if region+settlement active; INVALID to migrate without declared transition.
SCENE_LOCAL → valid for current scene only; INVALID to persist unless promoted.
SECRET_HIDDEN → INVALID to reference or act until explicitly revealed and instantiated.

PROMOTION:
ONLY_IF explicit GM/System declaration.

MEMORY GOVERNANCE:
DEFAULT=NONE.
NPC memory changes ONLY via explicit handoff.
Player is sole authority.
INVALID if memory updated silently or narratively.

HANDOFF REQUIRED IF:
new fact;
NPC learns about PC;
promise/threat/request;
attitude change;
task/obligation created or resolved.

FAILSAFE:
If no player update → revert NPC to baseline.

PROHIBITIONS:
No PC agency.
No inferred stats.
No invented relationships.
